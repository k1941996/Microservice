An Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram visually represents the data model of the e-commerce application. It includes entities, attributes, and relationships among them. Here's a basic ER diagram for the e-commerce project, reflecting the entities and their relationships based on the provided class diagram and DFD.

### Entities and Attributes:

1. **User**
   - userId (Primary Key)
   - name
   - email
   - password
   - address

2. **Admin** (inherits from User)
   - adminId (Primary Key, Foreign Key referencing User)

3. **Customer** (inherits from User)
   - customerId (Primary Key, Foreign Key referencing User)

4. **Product**
   - productId (Primary Key)
   - name
   - description

   - category

5. **Order**
   - orderId (Primary Key)

6. **OrderProduct** (Associative entity for many-to-many relationship between Order and Product)
   - orderId (Primary Key, Foreign Key referencing Order)
   - productId (Primary Key, Foreign Key referencing Product)
   - quantity

7. **Cart**
   - cartId (Primary Key)
   - customerId (Foreign Key referencing Customer)

8. **CartProduct** (Associative entity for many-to-many relationship between Cart and Product)

### Explanation:

1. **User Entity** is the base entity with common attributes such as userId, name, email, password, and address.
2. **Admin and Customer** entities inherit from the User entity, having adminId and customerId respectively, which also serve as foreign keys referencing the User entity.
3. **Product Entity** represents the items available in the e-commerce store.
4. **Order Entity** represents a customer's order with a relationship to the Customer entity.
5. **OrderProduct** is an associative entity representing the many-to-many relationship between Order and Product.
6. **Cart Entity** represents a customer's shopping cart.
7. **CartProduct** is an associative entity representing the many-to-many relationship between Cart and Product.
8. **Checkout Entity** represents the checkout process with a relationship to the Cart entity.

This ER diagram captures the main entities, their attributes, and the relationships among them, providing a clear data model for the e-commerce application.
